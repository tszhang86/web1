<h1>Superoxide anion</a> O<sub>2</sub>&#07;<sup>&#8722;</sup></h1>
<p>A superoxide is a compound that contains the superoxide ion, which has the chemical formula O<sub>2</sub>&#07;<sup>&#8722;</sup>. The systematic name of the anion is dioxide(1−). The reactive oxygen ion superoxide is particularly important as the product of the one-electron reduction of dioxygen O<sub>2</sub>, which occurs widely in nature. Molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons, and superoxide results from the addition of an electron which fills one of the two degenerate molecular orbitals, leaving a charged ionic species with a single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1. Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism.</p>
